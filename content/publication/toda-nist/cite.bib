abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. We present a method to compute the inverse scattering transform (IST) for the famed Toda lattice by solving the associated Riemannâ€“Hilbert (RH) problem numerically. Deformations for the RH problem are incorporated so that the IST can be evaluated in O(1) operations for arbitrary points in the (n, t)-domain, including short- and long-time regimes. No time-stepping is required to compute the solution because (n, t) appear as parameters in the associated RH problem. The solution of the Toda lattice is computed in long-time asymptotic regions where the asymptotics are not known rigorously.},
