I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Cincinnati. Previously, I was a postdoc at the University of Michigan, where my research mentor was [Peter D. Miller](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~millerpd/). My PhD thesis advisor was [Irina Nenciu](http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~nenciu/Site/Contact.html). My research has so far focused on problems arising in nonlinear wave formation and propagation.
