summary: This is a typical undergraduate course on ordinary differential equations. The material is based on the classes I taught at the University of Michigan in Spring 2016, Fall 2017, and Spring 2018. You may find interactive lecture notes (Jupyter notebooks) as well as some separate handwritten material from the series of examples titled "Here’s How I’d Do It".

This is a typical undergraduate course on ordinary differential equations. The following material is based on the classes I taught at the University of Michigan in Spring 2016, Fall 2017, and Spring 2018.

The Jupyter notebooks (see <a href="http://www.jupyter.org" target="_blank">Jupyter</a>) provided here are **just a proper subset** of what is covered in class and they are meant to be supplementary only.
The labs and the course used __MATLAB__, but in the notebooks I used the <a href="http://www.julialang.org" target="_blank">Julia</a> language. You do not need to have Julia installed on your computer or to view the Jupyter notebooks. The interactive features work with web browsers Safari, Firefox, and Google Chrome as of now. Other browsers were not tested.

## Textbook

Differential Equations: An Introduction to Modern Methods and Applications, by _James Brannan and William Boyce_, 2015 (3rd edition), Wiley.

## Examples --- Here's How I'd Do It
While teaching the course, I regularly posted _handwritten examples_ worked out in detail from somewhat more challenging subjects in the course. The series of these notes were called **Here's How I'd Do It**. The files in PDF format are available here:
