We continue the treatment of the heat equation and cover properties of the solutions of the initial-boundary-value problem (IBVP)
$$
\left\\{
\begin{alignedat}{2}
u_t -\Delta u &= 0\quad &&\text{in}~U_T\\\ u&=g\quad&&\text{on}~\Gamma_T
\end{alignedat}
\right.
$$
where $U_T:=U \times (0,T]$ is called a **parabolic cylinder**. Here $U\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is open and bounded, $T>0$ is a some terminal time, and $\Gamma_T:=\overline{U}_T \setminus U_T$ is the **parabolic boundary** of $U_T$.

We cover properties of the solutions of (IBVP), including

* Mean value property
* Maximum principles & uniqueness
* Regularity

We then consider the initial-value problem posed on $\mathbb{R}^n\times (0,T)$, discuss the maximum principle and uniqueness.
