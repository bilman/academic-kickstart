__Universality phenomena in numerical computation with random data__

_The speaker will discuss various standard numerical algorithms acting on random data. It turns out that the fluctuations in the time to compute the solution of the problem at hand to a desired accuracy, turn out to be universal, independent of the statistical assumptions on the data. Some of the results discussed are numerical and experimental, and some are proved rigorously. This is joint work with various authors, C. Pfrang, G. Menon, S. Olver, S. Miller, and (mostly) with Tom Trogdon._
